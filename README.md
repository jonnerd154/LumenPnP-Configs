# LumenPnP-Configs

This repository contains the OpenPnP and Marlin configurations I use for my Opulo LumenPnP.

Hardware Installed:
 - Original Opulo LumenPnP v2 BYOP Kit
 - Standard v3 Motherboard
   - Jumper wires soldered from DIAG1 on X and Y motor drivers, to their respective axis limit switch inputs
 - X & Y Linear Bearing rails (from @stargirl's mods, combining V2, V3 parts)
 - Sensorless homing on X/Y
 - Drag Chain / Cable Chain (installed using Opulo V3 machine parts)
 - Only Nozzle 1 is populated (not dual nozzle, yet)
 
 Build the Marlin firmware using Visual Studio and the Platform.io / Marlin plugin.
